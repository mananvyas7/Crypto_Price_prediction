# Crypto_Price_prediction


ðŸª™ Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using LSTM

ðŸ“Œ Description
This project aims to predict the future prices of cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a powerful variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) well-suited for time series forecasting.
The model learns from historical price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) and attempts to predict the next closing price based on trends and patterns.
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Collect historical cryptocurrency price data using yFinance API.
Preprocess the data for time series modeling.
Build and train an LSTM-based deep learning model for price forecasting.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
Deploy the prediction system using a Flask or FastAPI backend for API access.
Optionally connect to a React frontend for user interaction.
ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python (for data processing and modeling)
Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)
TensorFlow / Keras (for building the LSTM model)
scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics and preprocessing)
yFinance (to fetch crypto price data)
Flask / FastAPI (for backend API)
React.js (optional, for frontend visualization)
ðŸ“ˆ Workflow Overview
Data Collection â†’ using yFinance API.
Preprocessing â†’ Normalize, clean, and convert to supervised sequences.
Model Building â†’ LSTM model to learn temporal price patterns.
Training & Evaluation â†’ Split data, train model, validate predictions.
Prediction API â†’ Expose endpoint for predicting next-day price.
Frontend (Optional) â†’ Allow users to input date or range and get predicted prices.
ðŸ“Š Example Use Cases
Predict next-day Bitcoin closing price.
Forecast weekly trends in Ethereum.
Visualize actual vs predicted prices.
